Records various WordPress events to your server's system log for integration with Fail2Ban.

## Description ##

WP Fail2Ban Redux records various WordPress events to your server's system log for integration with [Fail2Ban](http://www.fail2ban.org/).

This plugin is (*mostly*) a drop-in replacement for [WP fail2ban](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fail2ban/) by [Charles Lecklider](https://charles.lecklider.org/).

While WP fail2ban is a great plugin, there are a number of improvements that could be made. In order to facilitate these improvements, a major refactoring of the codebase was necessary.

The core functionality between *WP Fail2Ban Redux* and WP fail2ban remains the same. *WP Fail2Ban Redux* is considered to be *mostly* a drop-in replacement, because all constants have been replaced with filters, and will, possibly, require some upgrade work. Don’t work it’s as simple as implementing the constants.

**The following events are recorded by default:**

* Failed XML-RPC authentication attempts.
* Successful authentication attempts.
* Failed authentication attempts -- differentiated by a user's existence.
* Pingback errors.

**The following events can be enabled via filter:**

* Pingback requests.
* Blocked user enumeration attempts.
* Authentication attempts for blocked usernames.
* Spammed comments.

## Installation ##

1. Upload the plugin to your plugins directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Copy the `config/filters/wordpress-hard.conf` and `config/filters/wordpress-soft.conf` files to your Fail2Ban filters directory (generally `/etc/fail2ban/filters.d`).
1. Copy the `config/jail/wordpress.conf` file to your Fail2Ban jail directory (generally `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d`), or append it's contents to your `jail.local` file. ***Make sure you read the notes in this file to aid successful setup.***
1. Reload or restart Fail2Ban.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### How do I upgrade from WP fail2ban? ###
If you haven't set any of the WP fail2ban constants, you don't need to do anything. If you have set some of the constants, [view the upgrade instructions](https://github.com/thebrandonallen/wp-fail2ban-redux/wiki/Upgrading-from-WP-fail2ban).

### Will the `wordpress-hard.conf` and `wordpress-soft.conf` filters still work? ###
Yes! All of the improvements made in *WP Fail2Ban Redux* were done in a way that would allow existing functionality to work without changes to your filters. However, the demo filters included with the plugin do contain some recommended changes. There are also new features not found in WP fail2ban that will require changes to your filters to be effective. These changes are linked, by filter, below:
[wordpress-hard.conf](https://github.com/thebrandonallen/wp-fail2ban-redux/compare/e3ec3c9...master#diff-03e39c06976d40fc41208c0ff448babd)
[wordpress-soft.conf](https://github.com/thebrandonallen/wp-fail2ban-redux/compare/e3ec3c9...master#diff-4f0afadcecac37d4c1b48730e5ca848c)

*Be ye forewarned: Future changes to WP fail2ban may break backwards compatibility with WP Fail2Ban Redux filters. No attempts will be made to fix this. So, even though it's not required, it is probably a good idea to update the filters anyway.*

## Changelog ##

### 0.3.1 ###
* Release data: 2017-05-18
* Bump minimum required WordPress version to 4.4.
* Performance improvements when not blocking user enumeration.
* Use `wp_die` to exit, to allow for greater customization of exit messages.
* Exit messages are now escaped using `esc_html`.
* Refactored plugin loading.
* You can now create your own, custom, logging class, in case you don't want to use the standard `syslog()` output.

### 0.3.0 ###
* Superseded by 0.3.1

### 0.2.1 ###
* Release date: 2017-02-15
* Fix a stupid syntax error in the comment spam filter :( Thanks to @ichtarzan for reporting!

### 0.2.0 ###
* Release date: 2016-09-27
* Fixed PHP notices where `WP_Fail2Ban_Redux::comment_spam` expects two parameters. Decided it was probably a good idea to oblige.
* User enumeration blocking now checks for both the `author` and `author_name` parameters. The `author_name` parameter could be used to validate the existence of a particular username, so blocking on this parameter as well will further reduce the attack surface.
* Fixes an issue where user enumeration blocking was overzealous and would prevent actions in the admin area. Props [pjv](https://github.com/pjv). [#2](https://github.com/thebrandonallen/wp-fail2ban-redux/issues/2)
* `WP_Fail2Ban_Redux::redirect_canonical` is now deprecated. If you were doing anything with this function, or the hook that initialized it, you should look at `WP_Fail2Ban_Redux::user_enumeration` instead.
* Added a note to `wordpress.conf` about the `logpath` parameter, and common auth log locations. *There is no need to changed existing configurations.* This is merely to aid setup for future users.

### 0.1.1 ###
* Release date: 2016-07-23
* In PHP < 7.0, `exit` isn't allowed as a method name. `WP_Fail2Ban_Redux_Log::exit` is now `WP_Fail2Ban_Redux_Log::_exit`.

### 0.1.0 ###
* Release date: 2016-07-13
* Initial release.
